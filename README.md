## Introduction

This project addresses a real-world problem by translating practical challenges into a scalable software solution. The goal is to bridge the gap between user needs and system capabilities through a well-structured, technology-driven approach.

The solution is designed with a strong emphasis on reliability, usability, and extensibility, ensuring measurable impact in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and overall user experience. This project demonstrates how sound engineering principles can be applied to deliver real value in a practical context.

## Solution Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

At a high level, the architecture consists of:

Frontend: Responsible for user interaction and presentation logic.

Backend: Handles core business logic, request processing, and system orchestration.

Database: Manages persistent data storage and retrieval.

This architecture enables smooth communication between components, improves fault isolation, and supports future expansion with minimal architectural changes.

## Software Designs

The software design is broken down into multiple detailed sub-sections to clearly explain how the system operates internally.

Key design aspects include:

Component-level decomposition

Data flow and interaction patterns

Interface definitions between modules

Design decisions and trade-offs

This structured design approach ensures the system remains robust, easy to understand, and adaptable to evolving requirements.

## Testing

Testing done on software : detailed + summarized results

## Conclusion

What was achieved, future developments, commercialization plans
